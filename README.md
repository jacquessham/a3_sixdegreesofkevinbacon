# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

## Background
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a concept saying that each person in the world could be linked within six connections. The idea of this project is to leverage the graph theory in data structure to implement this idea. I have used the data set of TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The idea is that the movie actors are connected within 6 connections and we can use a program to display the connection between two actors.
